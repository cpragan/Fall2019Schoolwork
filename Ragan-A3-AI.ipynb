Explain how you would address those issues. Notice that solving a course scheduling problem is a hard problem and a thorough CSP formulation and solution may potentially be defined as an industry project or maybe even a Master's thesis in academia! Nonetheless, in your answer, briefly explain the strategies that can be taken to find a good solution for this CSP. In natural language (without implementation and symbolic logic), add <b>at least two more constraints</b> to resolve some of the issues in the solution.\n",

I would also add the constraint that two different professors cannot have classes scheduled in the same room at the same time."
