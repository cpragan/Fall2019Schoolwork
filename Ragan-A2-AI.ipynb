    "Adversarial Search problems (aka games) deal with the competitive environments where the agents' goals are in conflict.  In AI, the most common games are **zero-sum** games of **perfect information** which implies the search environments are deterministic and fully-observable as well as the two agents act alternately and the utility values at the end of the game are *ALWAYS* equal and opposite.\n",

    "- In *Part I* of this assignment, you will implement minimax algorithm in Python to play Tic-Tac-Toe game against humans. Similar to Assignment-1, you are porvided with some read-only starter codes (helper functions and the skeleton of the code) to help you get started. You should put [`A2_utils.py`](https://github.com/fereydoonvafaei/UMBC-CMSC-471-Fall-2019/blob/master/Assignment-2/A2_utils.py) file in your working directory where your notebook is located.\n",

    "Answer the following questions HERE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Q1- In lines 59 and 61 of your `utility` function, can you increase the utility value for when the terminal state is \"human wins\", or on the contrary, decrease the value for when \"ai wins\"? Why or why not? **Hint:** Explain what assumption - if any - about the game would be violated if the two values are not equal and opposite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The utility value attached to a win can be increased for a human win and decreased for an ai win - so long as these values are equal and opposite. The zero-sum nature of a game like tic-tac-toe or chess is what makes this an adversarial search problem. In these games, for one player to win it is necessary for the other to lose. This is represented by having equal and opposite utility values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2- In lines 12 and 14 of your `minimax` function, explain why you pass minus infinity and plus infinity for human and ai respectively? What would happen if you reverse the two infinities for ai and human values? Explain. **Hint**: Look at Figure 5.3 of your textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "AI is the minimum searcher, so it must have its utility value initialized to positive infinity so that any other value will become the new minimum. The Human is the maximum searcher, so it must have its utility value initialized to negative infinity so that any other value will become the new maximum. If these values were switched, the minimax decision would never be accepted by AI or Human.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3- In line 27 of `minimax` function, explain why you pass `depth-1` and the opposite player in the recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depth-1 and the opposite player are passed to represent the change of turns from one player to another. This is like going down the tree diagram to a new layer, so depth must be decreased and the player changed to represent the change between max and min or vise versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Q4- The `MAX_DEPTH` is set to 9 in line 17 of the Tic-Tac-Toe runner. Can you explain why/if it would be a reasonable maximum depth of the search tree? Try running the algorithm with lower values for `MAX_DEPTH` and report any difference in its performance. What is the minimum depth required for the algorithm to function properly? Explain your observations and make arguments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nine is a reasonable maximum depth for the search tree in this case because tic-tac-toe is a game gauranteed to finish within 9 moves. Lower values of MAX_DEPTH can cause the ai to make a random move later into the game. The minimum depth to function properly would be 9. If MAX_DEPTH is between 8 and 0, the ai can make a random move rather than using minimax. Anything below zero has no affect on the game. Was the comment \"if depth equals maximum depth (look it up in the runner code below)\" in ai_plays() intended to say something else? The described implementation seems strange to me, MAX_DEPTH is only being used to make a random choice at one specific depth."

    "In Part II of Assignment-2, you have the opportunity to earn some extra credit by implementing the algorithm of your choice that can compete with minimax algorithm on Tic-Tac-Toe board. Here is the requirements for Part II:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can pick an algorithm that we've studied in class so far, e.g. Alpha-Beta pruning or Genetic Algorithm, or you may pick an algorithm that we haven't fully studied yet such as Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You may also search and see the publicly avilable open-source implementations. However, you should clearly explain and document the algorithm and your implementation. A simple copy/paste code would get **NO** extra credit even if it can play Tic-Tac-Toe error-free. You should also clearly and properly credit any source/reference you have consulted with.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Moreover, your implementation should be compatible with the provided helper functions in [`A2_utils.py`](https://github.com/fereydoonvafaei/UMBC-CMSC-471-Fall-2019/blob/master/Assignment-2/A2_utils.py) and the implemented minimax code in Part I.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally and most importantly, your implementation should be able to compete with your implemented minimax algorithm in Part I. You must write a wrapper function that makes the two algorithms play Tic-Tac-Toe and compete with each other in an \"AI-vs-AI\" manner and then you must report the results. All of these parts should be in the same notebook where you complete your Part I, i.e. THIS notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your implementation meets **ALL** of the requirements above, at my discretion and judgement of your work, you may be rewarded with extra credit equivalent to up to 50% of what Assignment-2 is worth in the final weighting/grading of the Assignment part of your final grade. This could be an opportunity to reserve some points for the points you may lose in your future assignments. Assignment-2 extra credit **can't** be used to compensate for other parts of your grade such as quiz or exams."

    "The remaining 10 points will be based on your writing and formatting as instructed in the notebook.  Follow the instructions of each section carefully. Points will be deducted if your submitted notebook is not easy to read and follow or if it has grammatical and spelling errors. Remember that you should **NOT** change the format of the notebook by deleting the text or instructions!"
